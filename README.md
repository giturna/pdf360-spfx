# pdf360-Viewer (SPFx version)

## Summary
**pdf360-Viewer** is an SPFx web part that lets you  

* upload **PDF plans** for each project  
* drag-and-drop **camera icons** onto the plan (position stored as X/Y percent)  
* attach one or more **360-degree panorama images** to every icon  
* view the panoramas in an in-browser viewer (mobile & desktop)  

All data is stored natively in SharePoint Online: one folder per project in the **Documents** library plus three helper lists.

## Prerequisites
Create three custom SharePoint **Lists** and make sure the default **Documents** library exists.

| List | Required Columns |
|------|------------------|
| **Projects** | *Title* (single line of text) |
| **IconLocations** | *Title* (text) • *Project* (Lookup → **Projects**, Title) • *PdfFile* (Lookup → **Documents**, ID) • *XPercent* (Number, 5 decimals, 0–1) • *YPercent* (Number, 5 decimals, 0–1) |
| **IconImages** | *Title* (text) • *Icon* (Lookup → **IconLocations**, Title) • *ImageFile* (Lookup → **Documents**, ID) |

> When a new project is created the web part automatically adds a **folder with the same name** inside **Documents** and stores all PDFs and images for that project there.
